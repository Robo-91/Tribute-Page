      <p id="img-caption">Nietzsche's body of work has continued to inspire works both in and out of philosophy, including art, psychology, popular culture, and existentialism.</p>

      <h4>A brief time line, including some of Nietzsche's most important works:</h4>

      <div id="tribute-info">
      <ul>
          <li><strong>1844</strong> - born in RÃ¶cken</li>
          <li><strong>1864</strong> - Nietzsche begins to study Theology and Classical Philology at Bonn.</li>
          <li><strong>1868</strong> - Nietzsche is offered a position as chair in Philology at the University in Basle.</li>
          <li><strong>1868</strong> - Nietzsche meets Wagner. They soon develop a passionate friendship, though it would be short-lived.</li>
          <li><strong>1883</strong> - Thus Spoke Zarathustra is Published.</li>
          <li><strong>1886</strong> - Beyond Good and Evil is Published.</li>
          <li><strong>1887</strong> - Genealogy of Morals is Published.</li>
          <li><strong>1888</strong> - Ecce Homo, Nietzsche's final work, is written (not published until 1908).</li>
          <li><strong>1889</strong> - An incident happens in Turin, Italy, where Nietzsche is arrested. His descent into madness is swift after this point, and popular consensus is that this was due to Nietzsche contracting Tertiary Syphilis</li>
          <li><strong>1900</strong> - Nietzsche dies from contracting pneumonia.</li>
      </ul>
      </div>

      <p>Though many of Nietzsche's ideas were (and perhaps still are) controversial, I believe that his body of work is life-affirming. We should strive to become the person that we want to be.</p>
